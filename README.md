# pstbn-like_project

This is an educational project in which I aimed to learn how to work with databases and http requests in golang.
It uses SQLite as a database and Golang as a source to handle requests to database.

This application can be used to store text data in a form of database entries, which can be shared with other users using aliases - links to these entries. By using these aliases, users can look at certain shared text entries in the database.
